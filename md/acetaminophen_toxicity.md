# Acetaminophen Toxicity

### Toxic ingestion dose: 150 mg/kg

## Pharmacology
Acetaminophen is metabolized through cytochrome P450 system to form toxic NAPQI metabolite, which requires glutathione to detoxify.

## Clinical stages of acetaminophen overdose

- Stage 1 (<24 hr): Abd pain, N/V, anorexia, lethargy, diaphoresis; normal labs
- Stage 2 (24-72 hr): RUQ abdominal pain, jaundice, rising AST/ ALT/INR values 
- Stage 3 (72-96 hr): Peak hepatotoxicity, renal insufficiency, and death vs. mild symptoms if treated
- Stage 4 (4 days-2 wk): 70% survive acute liver failure; resolution of symptoms


## Labs 
Draw serum acetaminophen level at 4 hours post-ingestion. 

## Treatment
Activated charcoal
: of benefit <1 hour of ingestion and possible benefit beyond 1 hour

N-acetylcysteine (PO or IV)
: precursor to glutathione. 

Start within 8-10 hours if:

- Above "possible hepatic toxicity" line
- Estimated single ingestion of acetaminophen >150 mg/kg
- Time of ingestion unknown and serum level > 10 mcg/mL
- Lab evidence of hepatotoxicity and history of excessive ingestion 
- Repeated ingestion and a serum level >10 mcg/mL

### PO Dosing:
140 mg/kg first dose and then 70 mg/kg every 4 hours. Typically treat for 20 hours for uncomplicated overdose.

### IV Dosing:
150 mg/kg first dose over 1 hour, then 50 mg/kg for first 4 hours, then 100 mg/kg over next 16 hours (total dose = 300 mg/kg over 20 hours)
