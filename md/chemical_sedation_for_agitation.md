# Chemical Sedation for Agitation



## Question
What single agent best manages violent, agitated patients in the ED, as measured by shortest time to sedation and shortest time to arousal.

## Methodology
- Prospective, randomized, double-blinded study of 111 violent and agitated patients
- Haldol (haloperidol 5 mg IM), Ativan (lorazepam 2 mg IM), or Versed (midazolam 5 mg IM)
- Versed is a water-soluble benzodiazepine - excellent IM absorption profile
- Patients were agitated because of recreational drug use, alcohol use, and prior psychiatric history and divided equally in each of the 3 arms of treatment.

## Results

Drug             | Time to sedation(min)   | Time to arousal
:------------    |--------------:          |----------------:
Haldol (n=42)    |    28.3 ± 25            |    126.5 ± 85
Ativan (n=27)    |    32.2 ± 20            |    217.2 ± 107
Versed (n=42)    |    18.3 ± 14            |    81.9 ± 66

There were no significant differences in vital signs between groups.

Ativan was stopped after the first 95 patients at interim analysis because of
prolonged sedation times.

Patients required "rescue drugs", which were additional sedation medications at the discretion of attending physician: 

- 8 Haldol patients (19%)
- 7 Ativan patients (26%)
- 7 Versed patients (17%)

Complications: 2 patients who received haldol

- 1 had hypotension
- 1 had transient apnea

## Bottom Line
Use versed 5 mg IM to chemically sedation a severely agitated patients because of its shorter time to sedation (18 min) and arousal (82 min).
