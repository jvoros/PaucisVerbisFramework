# C1 and C2 Fractures

## Atlanto-occipital dislocation
Mechanism
: flexion

Stable
: no

* Often instantly fatal
* More common in children because of small,
horizontally-oriented occipital condyles
* Dislocation can be anterior (most common), superiorly
distracted, or posterior

## Anterior atlantoaxial dislocation
Mechanism
: flexion

Stable
: no

* Associated with transverse ligament rupture
* Most commonly occurs in patients with rheumatoid
arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis from ligament laxity 
* Widening of predental space seen on lateral plain film

## Jefferson fracture, i.e. C1 burst
Mechanism
: axial compression

Stable
: no

* 33% with associated C2 fracture
* Low incidence of neurologic injury because of wide C1
spinal canal
* Usually involves fractures of both the anterior and
posterior C1 arches, often with 3 or 4 fracture
fragments
* Complication: transverse ligament rupture, especially if
C1 lateral masses are â‰¥7 mm wider than expected
(MRI recommended)
* Complication: vertebral artery injury (CT angiography
recommended)

## C1 posterior arch fracture
Mechanism
: extension

Stable
: yes

* An associated C2 fracture (occurs 50% of time) makes the posterior arch fracture unstable
* On plain films, no displacement of lateral masses on the odontoid view and no prevertebral soft tissue swelling, unlike Jefferson burst fracture

## C2 dens fracture
Mechanism
: flexion

Stable
: Sometimes

Type I (stable)
: Avulsion of dens with intact transverse ligament

Type II (unstable)
: Fracture at base of dens; 10% have an associated rupture of the transverse ligament- 
MRI provides definitive diagnosis of ligament rupture

Type III (stable)
: Fracture of dens extending into vertebral body

## Hangman's fracture, i.e. C2 spondylolisthesis
Mechanism
: extension

Stable
: no

* Bilateral C2 pedicle fractures
* At risk for disruption of the posterior longitudinal
ligament (PLL), C2 anterior subluxation, and C2-C3
disk rupture.
* Low risk for spinal cord injury because of C2 anterior
subluxation, which widens spinal canal

## Extension teardrop fracture
Mechanism
: extension

Stable
: no

* Small triangular avulsion of anteroinferior vertebral body, at insertion point of anterior longitudinal ligament
* Occurs most frequently at C2 level, but can occur in lower cervical spine
* Complication: central cord syndrome due to ligamentum flavum buckling during hyperextension
* Requires CT differentiation from very unstable flexion teardrop fracture
