# Red Eye

## Conjuctivitis
### Allergic
IgE mediated, usually associated with itching. Tx = cold compresses, OTC
topical vasoconstrictors, histamine-blocking eyedrops.

### Viral
Most common form of infectious conjunctivitis (usually adenovirus).
Preauricular LAN, global conjunctival injection, watery d/c, follicular reaction of inferior tarsal conjunctiva. Tx= cold compresses, artificial tears, topical decongestants, +/- topical abx if not able to discern from bacterial etiology.

* Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (adenovirus): Eye pain, decreased visual
acuity, corneal subepithelial infiltrates (1-2 mm gray-white crumb-like defects). 
* HSV conjunctivitis: More prevalent in HIV pts. Foreign body sensation in eye
(unlike typical viral conjunctivitis)
- No skin or corneal involvement: Tx= topical antivirals(trifluridine or
vidarabine) x 10-14 days
- Corneal involvement (dendrites seen): topical trifluridine and oral
acyclovir x 7-10 days. **NO STEROIDS**. 
* HZV ophthalmicus (VZV virus): reactivation through V1 nerve. Hutchinson
sign = herpes pustules at nose tip and is predictive of ocular involvement. Dendrites on exam. Tx=systemic vs topical antiviral agents, +/- steroids only with ophtho consult.

### Bacterial
Often assoc with morning crusting. Injection more pronounced at fornices. 

* Contact lens wearer: Pseudomonas risk. Tx=topical fluoroquinolone, cycloplegic
* Gonorrheal conjunctivitis: sexually active patients and neonates (from birth canal), "hyperacute conjunctivitis", abrupt onset, copious purulent discharge. Tx=topical abx, usually with systemic abx b/c assoc with venereal disease
* Inclusion conjunctivitis (Chlamydia): sexually active patients and neonates, mucopurulent discharge, FB sensation. Check for concurrent STI (symptomatic only 1⁄2 patients). Tx=topical erythro and po azithro x 1


## Subconjunctival Hemmorhage

* In setting of trauma and large hemorrhage, consider globe rupture
* Tx = warm compresses, lubrication drops

## Episcleritis

* Episclera = thin membrane over the sclera and beneath conjunctiva
* Benign self-limited inflammatory cond with focal area of dilated episceral vessels 
* Seen w/RA, PAN, lupus, inflam bowel dz, sarcoid, Wegener's, gout, HZV, syphilis 
* Tx= NSAIDs po

## Scleritis 
* Most common immune cause = RA. Most common vascuilitis cause = Wegener's 
* Sx: Severe eye pain radiating to ear, scalp, face, and jaw. Dull pain. Photophobia. 
* Exam: Deep episcleral plexus is vascularly engorged – appears blue-violet,
vessels non-blanching with vasoconstrictor, scleral edema 
* Tx: NSAIDs po +/- steroids po per ophtho consultation

## Uveitis

* Divided into anterior (iris, ciliary body) vs posterior (retinochoroiditis)
* Etiologies: inflammatory (50% assoc w/ systemic inflam dz), traumatic, infectious 
* Consider CMV in posterior uveitis in HIV patients
* Anterior uveitis: sudden, severe, painful eye; photophobia; perilimbal injection, consensual photophobia from unaffected eye
* Posterior uveitis: "floaters", flashing light– no redness or pain.
* Exam: inflammatory cells, proteinaceous flare
* Complications: cataracts, glaucoma, retinal detachment
* Tx: mydriatic or cycloplegic drops +/- steroids po only with ophtho consult

## Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma

* Sx: blurred vision, halos around lights, N/V, HA
* Pearl: Consider in all patients with "migraine HA's" – check pupil reactivity.
* Exam: corneal edema, mid-dilated NON-reactive pupil
* IOP with >30 mmHg requires prompt treatment
* Tx: Topicals - timolol, prednisolone, apraclonidine; Oral - acetazolamide
