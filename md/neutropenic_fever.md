# Neutropenic Fever in Cancer Patients

Chemotherapy causes neutropenia in 10-50% of pts with solid tumors and >80% of patients with hematologic malignancies during chemotherapy cycle.

## Definitions
Fever
: ≥ 38.3 C (101 F), or ≥ 38.0 C (100.4 F) over 1-hour period 

Neutropenia
: Absolute neutrophil count < 500 cells/mm3

## Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) score
5 points
: mild burden of febrile neutropenia

3 points
: moderate burden of febrile neutropenia

5 points
: SBP >= 90

4 points
: No COPD

4 points
: Solid tumor or hematologic malignancy with no previous fungal infxn

3 points
: No dehydration requiring IV fluids

3 points
: Outpatient status

2 points
: Age < 60 years

## High-risk patients requiring admission
- MASCC score < 21, or 

- Any of clinical findings: prolonged (> 7 days duration) and profound neutropenia (ANC ≤ 100), hypotension, pneumonia, new abdominal pain, neuro changes

## Low-risk patients who may be eligible for outpatient tx
- MASCC score ≥ 21

- Brief (≤ 7 days duration) neutropenic periods and few co-morbidities

## Workup

- CBC, BUN/Creatinine, electrolytes, AST/ALT, bilirubin
- Chest xray, if respiratory signs or symptoms
- 2 Blood cx (1 central line lumen if present + 1 peripheral vein, or 2 peripheral veins)

## Antibiotic Treatment
- Monotherapy: Antipseudomonal B-lactam (eg. cefipime, carbapenem, pip-tazo) 
- Add vancomycin ONLY IF suspect catheter-related infection, skin/soft tissue
infection, pneumonia, hemodynamic instability, colonization with MRSA/ VRE/
PCN-resistant Strep pneumoniae
- For PCN allergy: Ciprofloxacin + clindamycin, or aztremonam + vancomycin 
- For PO outpatient: Ciprofloxacin + amoxicillin-clavulanate

## Central line-associated blood stream infection (CLABSI)
REMOVE CATHETER
: If caused by S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, fungi, mycobacteria; presence of tunnel infection, pocket site infection, septic thrombosis, endocarditis, sepsis with hemodynamic instability, or bacteremia despite ≥ 72 hours abx

KEEP CATHETER
: and treat with abx if coag-negative staph
