# Appendicitis
# ACEP Clinical Policy

## WBC count >10K
- Positive LR 1.59, Negative LR 0.46 (Cardall et al, Acad Emerg Med 2004) 
- Positive LR 2.47, Negative LR 0.25 (Andersson, Br J Surg 2004)

## Alvarado Score 
Clinical score for predicting appendicitis (max 10 pts)

Symptom						| Points
:--------------------------	| -----:
Pain migration 				| 	1
Anorexia, acetone in urine 	| 	1
Nausea & vomiting 			| 	1
RLQ tenderness 				| 	2
Rebound pain 				| 	1
Temp > 37.3 oral 			| 	1
WBC > 10K 					|	2
> 75% PMNs 					| 	1

1-4
: appendicitis unlikely

5-6
: appendicitis possible

7-8
: appendicitis probable

9-10
: appendicitis very probable

- up to 8% of patients with score < 5 had appendicitis
- caution using score in patients <10 years or >60 years

## CT imaging
IV contrast improves ability to detect appy. *(Jacobs, Radiology 2001)*

- CT with PO/IV contrast - sensitivity 91%
- CT with PO contrast only - sensitivity 76%

Addition of oral contrast to CT Abd-pelvis (IV contrast) study is unnecessary. *(Anderson, Am J Surg 2005)*

- CT noncontrast – sensitivity 93%, specificity 98% 
- CT with PO/IV contrast – sens 93%, spec 93% 
- CT with rectal contrast – sens 97%, spec 97%

## Imaging in Pediatric Appy
U/S: appx >6 mm in diameter, non-compressible appx, appendiceal tenderness 

- Positive LR 17.2-49.5
- Negative LR 0.01-0.14

CT: Unclear about additional benefit of PO/IV contrast. Many give PO/IV because of less intraperitoneal fat in children (less obvious stranding on noncontrast study)

In kids, combination of (1) nausea, (2) RLQ pain, (3) difficulty walking, (4) rebound tenderness, and (5) absolute PMN>6,750 yielded negative LR=0.058. *(Kharbanda, Pediatrics 2005)*
